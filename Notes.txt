GENERAL

1. Use appropriate weights initialization methods depending on the activation function for the layer
(https://machinelearningmastery.com/weight-initialization-for-deep-learning-neural-networks/)
2. Add methods of formating input data
3. Do something with current interfaces: apply types to methods to make sure that only specific activations and losses are used.
4. Add keybind to exit/pause training at any moment (would require intoduction of asynchronous processes (like it wasn't obvious from the beginning)).
