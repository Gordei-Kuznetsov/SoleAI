GENERAL

1. Use appropriate weights initialization methods depending on the activation function for the layer
(https://medium.com/techspace-usict/normalization-techniques-in-deep-neural-networks-9121bf100d8)
2. Add methods of formating input data
3. Add method to save the model in a file (probably json)
4. Do something with current interfaces: apply types to methods to make sure that only specific activations, norm., and losses are used.
